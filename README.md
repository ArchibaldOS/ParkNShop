# ParkNShop
The PARKnSHOP.com Online Mall application enables vendors to set up online shops, customers to browse through the shops, and a system administrator to approve and reject requests for new shops and maintain lists of shop categories.  Also on the agenda is designing an online shopping site in English to manage the items in the shop and also help customers purchase them online without having to visit the shop physically.  PARKnSHOP.com Online Mall  will use the internet as the sole method for selling goods to its consumers. The consumer will be in complete control of his/her shopping experience. Shopping will be highly personalized and the mall will provide lower prices than most competitors. This, in brief, is a description of our product which will showcase a complete shopping experience in a small package.
